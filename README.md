# Corals Quiz
My personal project for the General Assembly course in Front End Web Development. I work at the Natural History Museum in the web content team  but these pages are not being used by the Museum. I just made up a fictitious brief. The idea is for a quiz that visitors can do on their mobile devices as they go around the Corals exhibition.
